// PC debug menu (not in the retail game; in the spirit of the March 2004 prototype's debug menu, which the retail
// build compiled out). Only with the launcher's Settings > Advanced > Debug mode on (pcinput.h fDebugKeys): with it
// off nothing here reads or swallows any input and the game runs exactly as without this file.
//
// F10, or R1 + Select on a pad, opens it: the game freezes (no world update at all) and a translucent panel lists
// Warps / Character / Noclip / Teleport / Jobs / Player / Speed / Display / Reset World / Save. D-pad or stick (or the
// arrow keys / W S / mouse wheel) move, Cross (Enter / Space / left click) selects, Circle / Triangle / Start (Esc /
// E / Q / right click) go back. F11 toggles the HUD.
//
// Everything that changes the save is marked "[save]" in the menu; the rest only changes the running game.
